Radical Libre License, Version 1.0 (RLL1.0)

Copyright (c) 2025 Ad4ndi

The Radical Libre License (RLL1.0) is a public license designed to protect the quality, beauty, and purpose of free software. It promotes a vision of programming as a form of creative, ethical, and academic expression, not as a commodity. Software licensed under RLL1.0 is intended to remain readable, meaningful, and non-commercial. It is based on the philosophy of anarcho-syndicalist openness and rejects the notion of intellectual property in favor of collective contribution.

Terms and Conditions

1. License Inheritance
   Any derivative works or projects incorporating code licensed under RLL1.0 must also be licensed under RLL1.0. Re-licensing under any other terms is strictly prohibited.

2. Attribution (Optional)
   Attribution is encouraged but not required. The Radical Libre License views authorship as secondary to the value of collective, purpose-driven creativity.

3. Code Clarity
   The code must not be intentionally obfuscated. Readability, clarity, and structural elegance are essential. Code that is intentionally cryptic, unreadable, or lacks aesthetic consideration shall be deemed Dead Code and a violation of this license.

4. Purpose Restrictions
   The software may not be used for:
     - Military purposes
     - Commercial exploitation
     - Advertising
     - Law enforcement
     - Surveillance
   Permitted use includes academic, artistic, educational, research, and activist contexts only.

5. Change Log Requirement

     - What was changed
     - Where it was changed
     - Why it was changed (rationale and intent)
   Unexplained modifications or undocumented forks are considered Dead Code and violate this license.

6. Human Authorship Only
   All code must be written entirely by human authors without the assistance of AI or machine-generated code. Any code authored by non-human systems is considered Dead Code and invalid under this license.

7. Manifest of Purpose
   Each project licensed under RLL1.0 must include a short manifesto (e.g., a `MANIFEST.md` file) explaining the projectâ€™s intended usefulness or artistic/academic value. Projects lacking a declared purpose shall be considered Dead Code.

8. No Propaganda
