# RLL-1.0
The Radical Libre License v1.0 – an anti-commercial ethical license for code and creativity. 

## Manifest

RLL-1.0 tries to convey that the creativity of programmers is often used for commercial and/or not entirely legal purposes. In this regard, the code written under the RLL-1.0 license is available for editing/copying ONLY if the fork is also under the RLL-1.0 license.

The main idea of ​​the license is that the priority is the quality of the code. Projects that were written using artificial intelligence, are intentionally obfuscated, or do not have a small manifest are considered dead code and a license violation.

As mentioned earlier - each project needs a manifest: "Why is this program useful for the author/community?", "What are the advantages over similar programs?", etc. Similarly, for forks - a change log is needed: what, where, when and why was changed. This approach is very convenient for those who want to study someone else's code, and it is convenient to navigate in projects.

The RLL-1.0 license can be used by ANYONE, as long as they follow its terms and ideology.
