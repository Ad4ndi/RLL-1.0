# RLL-1.0
The Radical Libre License v1.0 â€“ an anti-commercial ethical license for code and creativity. 

## Manifest

RLL1.0 is designed to improve the free software environment by making the terms of the agreement stricter, allowing ONLY academic and artistic use of the software. The main goal is to make the open source environment cleaner, where there will be no "dead code", namely code written by AI, intentionally obfuscated or meaningless.

The RLL1.0 license can be used by ANYONE, as long as they follow its terms and ideology.
